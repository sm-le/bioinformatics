# Polymerase Chain Reaction #
#############################

# Sequencing requires many copies of DNA
# PCR uses a couple simple propeties of DNA
# - DNA sticks to itself
# Start with DNA and primers
# 1. melt (heat the mixture gently)
# 2. anneal (cool down gently)
# 3. DNA polymerase, attach to one strand of DNA and fill in missing sequences where primers are attached, and nucleotide mixture
# 4. repeat whole process and doubling continues

##############################
# Next generation sequencing #
##############################

# Sanger DNA sequencing -> DNA -> 2nd Generation DNA sequencing -> 3rd generation DNA sequencing
# Still 2nd generation DNA sequencing is widely used
# 1. chop DNA into small pieces
# 2. chemically attach to slides
# 3. use PCR to make identical copies (making clusters)
# 4. add specially treated nucleotide so with laser they fluorescent four different colors.
# 5. reversible terminator modification so we can remove modification and let the polyemerase go on.
# 6. reading bases based on colors.

# Error increase in later cycle
# 1. One schedule, behind, ahead
# 2. polymerase can be erroneous
# 3. Error code exist to give quality score


#############################
# Application of sequencing #
#############################

# Convert molecule to DNA
# Apply 2nd genetic sequencing

# Exome sequencing
# 1. when interested in knowing mutation affecting proteins
# 2. sequence much less than DNA

# RNA-seq
# 1. trying to capture all the genes that are being turned on
# 2. RNA has a long AAA tails -> ignore ones without poly As
# 3. poly T tails to capture poly A tails and reverse transcription to turn RNA into DNA

# Chip-seq
# 1. where DNA certain proteins might bind (control gene expression)
# 2. Design antibody to pull proteins out after binding
# 3. remove protein and sequence the DNA

# methyl-seq
# 1. where on the genome that DNA is methylated
# 2. split into two identical samples
# 3. treat with bisulfite conversion -> convert all unmethylated C to U
# 4. Sequence and compare
