################
# Why Genomics #
################

# Understand how our body develop,
# 1) every development signals are coded in our genome.
# 2) How a mutation in your genome drives the cancer from erroneous cell replication.

# Central Dogma
# - Information flows in a single direction from your genome
#  DNA (transcription) -> RNA (translation) -> Protein

#  * Protein can self-regulate (modifier such as methylation)
  #  - Information actually flow backward

# To understand which mutations are associated
# - We need sequencing.
# - Which advancement of sequencing technology, cancer sequencing is possible

# With cheaper sequencing and more sequencing power, thousands of genomes are available now

####################
# What is Genomics #
####################

# - Studies considering all genes in a genomes
#  * Using global, high-throughput experiments
#  * Tons of data, uncertainty and computation

 ################################
 # What is Genomic Data Science #
 ################################

 # Take big dataset, apply computational and statistical methods.

 ############################
 # Just Enough Cell Biology #
 ############################

# Cellular Organism into three domain:
# 1) Eukaryotes
#  - has cell nucleus as opposed to prokaryotes
#  - Mitochondrion is a powerhouse of the cell, incorporated into Eukaryotes from an independent prokaryotes billions of years ago
# 2) Archaea
# 3) Bacteria

# Cell undergo cycles:
# - critical is the process of the division.
# - cells are constantly dying and need to be replaced as a result of process called mitosis.
# - sexual reproduction is called meiosis

# Cell don't always divide and produce two identical copies, it differentiate into different cells

# Recombination makes a unique set of chromosomes different from parents driving diversity

############################################
# Important Molecules in Molecular Biology #
############################################

# Key molecules
# - critical molecules in determining how your genomes functions

# 1. DNA
# - writing blocks are as AGCT
#   - Adenine and Guanine as purines and thymine and cytosine as pyrimidines
# - Structure in a form of twisted helix
# - directionality goes from five prime to three prime.

# 2. RNA
# - similar to DNA but T is replaced with U: uracil
# - is single stranded, but can form double strand
# - a template to make proteins
# - 64 possible combination as in three amino acid codon, but three of them are stop codons.

############################
# The Human Genome Project #
############################

# sequence all 3 billion base pairs
# - use BAC of 150,000 sized base pairs and stitched back together
# - bacterial whole genome was published using shotgun approach
# - Applied biosystems' new machine was automatic and faster than previous
# - race started when Celera Genomics' planning to use shotgun sequencing with human genome, first to show drosophila
# - both tied
# - major goals of the Human Genome Project was to identify all the genes and to develop better treatments and improve human health
# - only resulted inprecise number of genes
# - even today no precise number but maybe 18k to 22k

###############################
# Molecular Biology Structure #
###############################

# - DNA is long molecular wrapped around the histones to form chromosomes.
# - Repeats: Tandem repeats (repeats of sequence), interspersed repeats (spread out repeats)
# - RNA structure: cap, 5'UTR (not translated region), CDS, 3'UTR (longer strecth untranslated), Poly-A tail (feature of eukaryotic cell)
# - DNA and RNA has exons and introns, coded sequences are exons concatenated together.
# - alternative splicing putting exons in different orders (90% of human genes).
# - Proteins are strands of amino acids with secondary structure (alpha helices and beta sheets)
# - Transcription factors, control activity of cells, control expression of proteins.
# - epigenetic structures, methyl group (inheritable), is controlling factors on genetic expression.

##############################
# From genotype to phenotype #
##############################

# loosely thinking as recessive or dominant types of traits.
# mapping out genetic variation tells genetic traits are tend to be regionalized.
# large number of group and control, look at particular location and compare if genetic variation in that gene tended to be associated with that disease that we were studying
# - genome wide association study
