# Challenges of Reproducibility #
#################################

Galaxy is a web-based platform for performing data intensive science
It is particularly suited for genomics, and tools for many different types of genomic data analysis have been integrated in Galaxy
will describe some of the research challenges that motivated the development of the Galaxy framework

Biology has become data intensive, and dependent on complex computational and statistical method

How can we ensure that scientific results is reproducible?
- Reproducibility is an issue in genomic studies.
- less than 30% of paper can be identified.
- method and version matters in software and it is important for us to know for reproducibility.

What is reproducibility?
- not provenance, not reusability, not correctness.
- an analysis is described in sufficient detail that it can be precisely reproduced.

Recommendation
1. Accept that computation is an integral component of biomedical research
2. always provide access to raw primary data
3. record versions of all auxillary datasets, or archive.
4. store the exact version of all software used. Ideally archive the software.
5. record all parameters, even if default values are used.

Can reproducibility be achieved?
1. Command line best practice
2. Analysis environment
3. Workflow systems
4. Notebook style
5. Literate programming
6. System level provenance capture
7. Complete environment capture

Galaxy is one way to keep reproducibility!

# Introduction to Galaxy Platform #
###################################

Galaxy Platform
- Available through the web.
- integrating a wealth of tools, compute resources, terabytes of reference data and permanent storage.

Core concepts of galaxy
1. Describe analysis tool behaviour abstractly
2. Analysis environment automatically and transparently tracks details
3. workflow system for complex analysis, constructed explicitly or automatically
4. pervasive sharing, and publication of documents with integrated analysis
5. visualization and visual analysis platform

But computing demand only increase over time, so galaxy can be a solution
Alternative can be 1. local installation, and 2. cloud computing

1. local installation, download and run
- more than 60 known public galaxy server

2. cloud computing
- cloud man for any cloud such as amazon, nectar, or google and such

# Summary #
###########
1. reproducibility is crucial to computational research, but currently poorly implemented
2. galaxy is one platform that seeks to make computational analysis more accessible, transparent, and reproducible.
3. It can be used as a free web service, installed locally, or deployed in a cloud environment.
