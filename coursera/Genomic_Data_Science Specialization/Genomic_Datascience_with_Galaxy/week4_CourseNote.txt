# Genomic Data Science with Galaxy - RNA-seq

########################
# top Hat Availability #
########################

Tools for genomic analyses are continually being updated,
and occasionally it is necessary for Galaxy to mark
a tool as deprecated to indicate it is no longer the preferred way to perform an analysis.

We have deprecated TopHat because it is less efficient than some newer tools.
However it is still available, and can be used to complete the analysis for this module,
just search for "TopHat" on Galaxy main.

Alternatively, you can use either HiSat or STAR,
both of which produce a bam file which can be used in the same way as the output of TopHat (although the results may change).

RNA-seq Exercise
1. Create new history
2. Get Human RNA-seq:CHB ENCODE Exercise
3. Select all Dataset in folder and import

It is always good to run FASTQC for quality control, but we will skip here.

Short RNA-seq background
1. fragmentation of RNA
2. random priming to make secDNA
3. construction of dscDNA
4. size selection
5. sequencing

With RNA seq data, we can
1. Align reads to genome
  - potentially more sensitive, but requires a reference genome, confounded by structural variation
2. Assemble transcript de novo
  - likely to only capture highly expressed transcripts, but does not require a reference genome, robust to variation

In this lecture, tophat was used, but not it is decommissioned. So I will use HISAT2

Summary
- RNA-seq analysis using a reference genome requires an aligner that is splicing aware (can handle long "deletion" in the read)
- StringTie, HISAT2, and Sailfish is such program that align

Assembling RNA-seq data after mapping to a reference genome

- Spliced alignment provides estimates of 1) locations of exons, and 2) splice junctions

- Normally we use Cufflink (which is now deprecated) for assembly quantitation. We used StringTie and DESeq2

Summary
- Using the spliced alignment from Tophat and cufflink like program, allows us to assemble transcirpt in Galaxy
- Stringtie will also quantify the relative abundance of each transcript in each sample
- DEseq2 performs a statistical test for differential expression based on quantitation data from multiple conditions

Quiz

''''
1. What does it mean to align-then-assemble?
- Align reads to an existing reference genome, and then assemble transcripts from the spliced alignments

2. Which of the following statements is FALSE?
- De-novo assembly is not robust to variation

3. Tophat result produce BED and BAM

4. Cuffdiff is used to find differentially expressed gene

5. Length of differentially expressed gene is not an output of Cuffdiff

6. Cuffmerge is to merge different cufflinks assemble together and GTF files

7. Can we use Galaxy to run the same tophat (or other tool) job over Multiple datasets?
- Yes, the datasets need to be of the format the tool can take as input

8. What Galaxy tool might we use to refine our Cuffdiff output to show only differentially expressed genes?
- Filter

9. What comes after mapping the RNA seq data to a reference genome?
- Using a reference annotation we continue to do differential expression analysis using the Cufflinks suite

10. What is the idea behind setting the tool form “Use Reference Annotation” to “reference annotation as guide” in Cufflinks
- Tell Cufflinks to use the reference annotation to guide the assembly
- Results will contain referenced transcript, novel genes and isoforms

11. What does the “log2(fold change)” in the gene differential expression testing result mean?
- Its the log ratio of FPKM values for a pair of expressed genes
- It indicates genes with significantly different expression profiles.

# Galaxy on the Cloud #
#######################

Cloud computing is network accessible compute resources that can be rapidly acquired, configured and released

Here we will use amazon web services
https://aws.amazon.com

After setting up amazon web service account, make a separate group to give an access to galaxy cloud. Allow it to use EC2

Then in usegalaxy.org click cloud and type your passcode and secret passcode to start initiating your galaxy cloud
