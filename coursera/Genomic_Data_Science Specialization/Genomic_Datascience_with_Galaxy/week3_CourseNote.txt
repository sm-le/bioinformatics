# Sequence Data Quality Control #
#################################

In this module, we are going to look at doing sequence quality control.

Quality control analysis

- Get the data
1. Import (Shared data)
2. Data Libraries
3. illumina iDEA datasets (sub-sampled)
4. BT20 paired-end RNA-seq subsampled (end 1)

What is FASTQ
- Specifies sequence (FASTA) and quality scores (PHRED)
- Text format, 4 lines per entry
- Several variants to how FASTQ scores are encoded.

NGS Data Quality: Assessment tools
- NGS QC and Manipulation -> FastQC
    Gives you a lot of information but little control over how it is calculated or presented
- In Galaxy under tool menu
  1. Find fastQC
  2. Load dataset and execute

- Webpage sequence quality summary summarize NGS quality

NGS Data Quality: Trim as we see fit
- trim as we see fit: Option 1 (Trim in Galaxy) (delete column)
  1. NGS QC and Manipulation -> FASTQ Trimmer by column
  2. Trim same number of columns from every record
  3. Can specify different trim for 5' and 3' ends
  - Select high quality segment, Manipulate FASTQ, FASTQ Quality Trimmer

NGS Data quality: Base Quality Trimming
- filter as we see fit: option 2 (delete entire read)
  1. NGS QC and manipulation -> Filter FASTQ reads by quality score and length
  2. Keep or discard whole reads
  3. Can have different thresholds for different regions of the reads
  4. Keeps original read length

- trim as we see fit: Option 3
  1. NGS QC and Manipulation -> FASTQ Quality Trimmer by sliding window
  2. Trim from both ends, using sliding windows, until you hit a high-quality section
  3. Produces variable length reads

How we decide?
- Choice depends on downstream tools
- Find out assumptions & requirements for downstream tools and make appropriate choices now.
- How to do that?
  1. read the tool documentation
  2. biostars.org
  3. seqanswers.com
  4. galaxyproject.org/search

Summary
1. Many factors can effect the quality of DNA sequencing data
2. FASTQC is one tool that allows evaluating a number of quality metrics for FASTQ datasets from many sequencing platforms
3. The galaxy FASTQ manipulation tools can help to salvage quality sequences from lower quality data
4. When filtering or trimmering reads, be sure to take into account the requirements of downstream analysis

# ChIP-Sequence Analysis with MACS #
####################################

ChiP sequence analysis in Galaxy with tool called MACS
- Tag distributions represent the end of the sequenced fragment. A shift is necessary to resolve the center of the bound region (peak)
- MACS empirically models the amount of this shift to better determine the bound region

MACS fragment shift
- Given a sonication size (b) and fold enrichement (f), find windows of size 2b that are f-fold enriched
- Sample 1000 of these high-quality windows, separate tage by strands, and find distance between the modes to estimate d
- Shift all tags by d/2 in the 3' direction

Work Flow, ChIP-Seq Analysis: Get the Data
1. Shared Data from Data libraries
2. Demonstration Datasets
3. Select everything in the Mouse ChIP-seq: G1E CTCF Binding folder

To analyze G1E CTCF on mm9
1. Choose bowtie2
2. select G1E CTCF on mm9 reference genome

ChIP-Seq Analysis: Find Peaks
1. NGS: Peak Calling -> MACS
2. Experiment name -> MACS G1E_CTCF
3. Tag File -> G1E_CTCF BAM file
4. Tag size -> 36 (length of base pair read)
5. Leave MFOLD -> 32
6. Check perform the new peak detection method (futuredir)

Potential ChIP Biases
- Problems
1. chromatin accessibility affects fragmentation
2. Amplification bias
3. Repetitive regions

- Solution: Controls
1. Input DNA (after fragmentation but before IP)
2. Non-specific IP

MACS Peak detection
- After shift, slide windows of size 2d across genome
- Model tag count for windows as a poisson distribution, and calculate a p-value for each window
- For the lambda parameter (~expected number of tags per window), estimate from sample or control if available
  * Estimates for local windows of size 1kb, 5kb, 10kb or the whole genome and uses the max

Summary
1. MACS is one tool, available in Galaxy, for analysis of ChIP-seq data
2. Controls are extremely important for accurately calling ChIP-seq peaks
3. As for most genomics problem, there are other tools that may be more appropriate depending on the type of data, for example SICER for broad histone modifications.
