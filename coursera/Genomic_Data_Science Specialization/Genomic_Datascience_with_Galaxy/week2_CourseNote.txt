# Galaxy 101: Genomic Intervals #
#################################

In this module and the following modules we will start to use Galaxy to perform different types of analysis.
Note that if you attempt these analysis yourself the tool versions and interfaces may be slightly different.
Genomics is an extremely rapidly moving field, and tools change very frequently -- sometimes more than once a day.
So while there may be additional or slightly modified options for some tools,
all of the analysis we describe can still be performed, and it should be fairly obvious what options to use.

Basic Analysis: on human chromosome 22, which coding exons have the most repeats in them?

- General plan
1. Get some data
2. Identify which exons have Repeats
3. Count repeats per exon
4. Save, download exons with most repeats

- usegalaxy.org
get exon data
1. create new to start new history
2. grab public data from ucsc main
3. crs22 and get exons, after configuration, click get output

get repeats
1. select Repeats group and track RepeatMasker
2. select BED format and send to galaxy

Both files will be in chromosome, position, Name, Score format, sequence

Now we are going to look for cases they overlap

- One way to do this is to count the overlap
1. operate on genomic intervals -> Join (identify which exons have Repeats)
2. In Join data, genome data, with repeats data to inner join
3. first six field are genome file and other six files are from repeats file
4. to get count, we need to use group tool (take all the row and group them)
5. For this, we need join dataset which we just generated and load the dataset on group tool and execute on column 4

Then we would like to get back exon information

1. Join, Subtract, and Group -> Join (Incorporate the overlap count with rest of Exon information)
2. Join genome and group data
3. Cut columns 1,2,3,4, and 8 from the join table

Summary
1. Interactive analysis in Galaxy is performed by using tools to operate on datasets
2. Datasets are immutable, and running tool always creates one or more new datasets
3. Datasets are available through history, which provides complete provenance for each dataset

# Galaxy 101: Workflows #
#########################

In last exercise, we looked at human cr22 and overlap between exon and Repeats
But it is not reusable workflow
1. there is nothing inherent in the analysis about human, exons or repeats
2. it is a series of steps that sets the score of one set of features to the number of overlaps from another set of features.

Galaxy workflow
- takes this abstract representation and represented as a tool without being tied to certain dataset

We can do this either by 1) scratch or 2) by example
1) We compose a workflow directly
2) or we extract from previous history

It is easier to extract workflow from history as we completed analysis previously
- Click history option and extract workflow
- Here, we should treat UCSC main as input datasets and create

Now we want to test our workflow with different dataset.
Use UCSC database to collect Regulation, CpG islands and send to Galaxy

Now we are going to exactly same work but replace repeats with CpG islands.
- Select all workflow under tools tab and run our custom workflow

We simplify our history and workflow, we can filter in workflow editor

Summary
1. Galaxy workflows allow abstract multi-step analysis to be reused
2. Workflows can be constructed either by example or from scratch
3. The workflow editor allows workflows to be customized, and additional actions to be associated with each step

# Galaxy 101: Annotating, Sharing, and Publishing #
###################################################

Tagging and annotation
- To add extra information such as dataset, history
- Nearly all Galaxy entities can be tagged or annotated
1) Tag: short, structured metadata associated
2) Annotation: Completely free-form text used to describe or contextualize

Sharing and Publishing
1) Share: Make something available to someone else
2) Publish: Make something available to everyone
3) Galaxy page: Analysis documentation within Galaxy

Sharing and Publishing enables Reproducibility
- Galaxy aims to push the goal of reproducibility from the bench to the bioinformatics realm
- All analysis in Galaxy is recorded without any extra effort from the user
- Histories, workflows, visualizations and pages can be shared with others

From galaxy page, we can extract workflow and re-run to see the parameter ourselves.

Way to share data
1) Data library
2) Galaxy Tool shed

Summary
1. Everything you do in Galaxy can be shared and published for others to access
2. Tagging and annotations allow to provide more information about the steps of your analysis
3. Galaxy pages provide a way for a way to describe multiple entities that make up an entire analysis in a way that readers can easily access all of the details
