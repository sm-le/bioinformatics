.Basic steps

1) Fragment DNA.
2) Add adapter sequence in both ends.
3) Each bead contains a specific single stranded sequence all round. Through adapter fragmented DNA can bind to the bead.
4) Beads, then, placed inside tiny wells within a microchip
5) addition of dATP allows selective hybridization that generates hydrogen ion (H+).
6) Ion sensitive layer can detect pH change from hydrogen ion (H+) release
7) Everytime there is a pH change, we get a base call from a voltage change.
