.summary
BCL -> FASTQ -> SAM/BAM (even visualize) -> Variant calling (also can visualize)
demultiplexing -> BWA -> GATK/VarScan2 -> IGV/Gbrowse/Jbrowse

.identify purpose
de novo or re-sequencing with reference
.workflow
1) sample prep
2) load samples
3) cluster generation
4) sequencing
5) results

.detail workflow (illumina)
..Input, assess quality, library prep
1) Is DNA degraded?
If not, move to library prep
If yes, obtain new sample
..basic library preparation
1) fragment DNA
2) Add adapter on both ends
..cluster generation/bridge PCR
After this you will end up with small cluster of identical DNA sequences
..illumina sequencing by synthesis
fluorescent labeled nucleotide which will image by the sequencer.

.quality control
..quality and quantity
1) run DNA gel to check degradation or low concentration
2) quantity by nanodrop or qubit
..assess fragmentation
1) agilent bioanalyzer
..adapter ligation
1) qPCR (how much of your library is sequenceable)

.data output
1) Raw Data (raw sequencing data)
2) FASTQ (fasta with QC info)
3) Data analysis (alignment to reference genome)

.with reference genome
SNP and Short Indel calling
Variant Detection
Impact Annotation
Phylogenetic Analysis
Functional Enrichment Analysis

.wihout reference genome
De novo assembly
Gene prediction
Functional Annotation
Gene Family Clustering

.tools variant calling
1) GATK | runs longer, maybe false negative
2) VarScan2 | runs short, increased false-positive

.tools visualization
1) Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) | easy to use, fast, need lots of computing power
2) Genome Browser (GBrowse) | create website, learning curve, internet connection
3) JBrowse | faster than GBrowse
