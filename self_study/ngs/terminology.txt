.Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs)
UMIs are short DNA molecules which are ligated to DNA fragments.
The randomized UMIs assure every fragments-UMIs combination is unique in the library.
PCR clones can be identified by searching non-unique fragment-UMI combinations (PCR clones).
.De-duplication
It is a process to discard PCR clones.
This process can be performed before and after mapping.
If de-duplication happens after mapping, the sequences of UMIs need to be clipped away as the synthetic strings of nucleotide do not occur in the genome.
.Multiplexing
Multiplexing allow large number of libraries to be pooled and sequenced simultaneously during a single run.
This is useful when targeting specific genomic regions or working with smaller genomes.
Individual "barcode" sequences are added to each DNA fragment during next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation so that each read can be identified and sorted before the final data analysis.
.single-end sequencing
reading from only one strand
1) appropriate for changes in gene expression
2) interested in read-count
.paired-end sequencing
reading a fragment from both strands
1) whole genome sequencing project
.read length
The number of nucleotides that are sequenced per read
1) 75nt, suitable for prokaryotic or simpler genomes
2) 150nt, common for eukaryotic or more complex genomes
3) 10000+nt, ideal for gapless assembly
.contigs
A set of overlapping DNA sequences, usually there are multiple contigs
.gapless sequencing
can be acheived by
1) shorter reads, deeper sequencing (cheapest)
2) longer reads with long contigs (more expensive)
3) best is combination of both above
.sequencing depth
bigger genome require more reads/sequencing
important to calibrate sequencing depth based on genome size
