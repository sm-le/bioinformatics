.alingn to reference genome
1) BWA
2) Bowtie2 - use indexing (Burrows-Wheeler transform)
3) Maq - use indexing (space seed indexing)
4) Stampy
5) Novoalign

.align de novo
1) ABySS
2) SOAPdenovo

use of contig that potentially encompass the entire genome.

.SAM file after alignment (or BAM)
contains the sequence and quality scores of each read
provide more detailed information than the fastq file (genome location)

.variant calling
examine mapped data with reference genome for SNPs or SNV or INDELs.

1) SAMtools mpileup - use Bayesian algorithm
2) GATK4 - use Bayesian algorithm

.Data visualization
1) Integrative genomics viewer
2) UCSC genome browser

.RNA seq
only cover a partial area

1) TopHat
2) STAR

.Exome seq
similar to whole genome

.additional Data
1) FastQC - quality control
2) PICARD - command line tool for SAM/BAM
